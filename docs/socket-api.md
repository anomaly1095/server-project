# API Reference

## Unix Sockets

**Description:** Unix sockets provide a means for inter-process communication (IPC) on Unix-like operating systems.

### Socket Creation

**Description:** Creating a Unix socket involves several steps including socket creation, binding, and listening (for server) or connecting (for client).

**Functions:**
- `socket()`: Create a new Unix socket.
- `bind()`: Bind a name to a Unix socket.
- `listen()`: Listen for connections on a Unix socket (server).
- `connect()`: Connect to a Unix socket (client).

### Data Transmission

**Description:** After establishing a connection, data can be transmitted between processes using read and write operations.

**Functions:**
- `read()`: Read data from a Unix socket.
- `write()`: Write data to a Unix socket.
- `recv()`: Receive data from a Unix socket.
- `send()`: Send data to a Unix socket.

### Address Structures

**Description:** Unix sockets use address structures to specify the local and remote endpoints of a connection.

**Structures:**
- `struct sockaddr_un`: Structure for specifying the local and remote socket addresses for Unix sockets.

### Polling

**Description:** Polling allows monitoring multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them.

**Functions:**
- `poll()`: Wait for events on multiple file descriptors.

### Example Function

**Description:** Example function demonstrating the usage of Unix sockets for client-server communication including polling.

```c
/**
 * @brief Example function for Unix socket communication.
 * 
 * This function demonstrates the basic steps involved in setting up a Unix socket server and client,
 * establishing a connection, and transmitting data between them. It also includes polling for events
 * on multiple file descriptors.
 * 
 * @param argc Number of command-line arguments.
 * @param argv Array of command-line arguments.
 * @return 0 on success, -1 on failure.
