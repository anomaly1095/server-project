# Secure Network Communication System

This project implements a robust and secure network communication system with extensive features such as two-step authentication, physical authentication using USB flash drives, encryption using libsodium, multithreading, multiplexing, and a dedicated module for error handling and logging.

## Features

- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes asymmetric and symmetric encryption to ensure secure communication over the network.
- **Two-Step Authentication**: Implements a two-step authentication system to enhance security.
- **Physical Authentication**: Offers the option for physical authentication using USB flash drives with SHA-512 encryption.
- **Multithreading**: Utilizes multithreading to handle concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Multiplexing**: Implements multiplexing to handle multiple network connections concurrently.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation covering all aspects of the project, including setup, usage, and architecture.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Incorporates a dedicated module for error handling and logging, ensuring robustness and ease of debugging.
- **MySQL C API Integration**: Integrates the MySQL C API for database interaction, enabling seamless integration with MySQL databases.
- **Libsodium Encryption**: Utilizes libsodium for encryption, providing strong cryptographic security.
- **Low-Level Network API Interface**: Implements a low-level network API interface for efficient network communication.
